# MIPS32 Processor with Pipelining

## Project Overview
This project implements a MIPS32 processor in a pipelined fashion using the Verilog hardware description language. The processor supports a variety of operations, including arithmetic, selection, branching, memory operations, and halting. The project also includes three test cases to validate the functionality and performance of the processor.

### Key Features:
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Implements instruction pipelining for improved performance.
- **Supported Instructions**:
  - Arithmetic Operations:
    - `ADD`: Addition
    - `SUBTRACT`: Subtraction
    - `MULTIPLY`: Multiplication
  - Immediate Operations:
    - `ADD IMMEDIATE`
    - `SUBTRACT IMMEDIATE`
    - `SELECT IMMEDIATE`
  - Memory Operations:
    - `LOAD`: Load data from memory
    - `STORE`: Store data to memory
  - Branching:
    - `BRANCH`
  - Control:
    - `HALT`

- **Test Cases**: Includes three comprehensive test cases to demonstrate and verify the processorâ€™s functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- A Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, or Icarus Verilog)
- A waveform viewer for analyzing the pipeline stages (e.g., GTKWave)

### Running the Simulation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project
   ```
2. Open the desired test case file from the `testbench/` directory.
3. Compile the Verilog files and the testbench using your simulator:
   ```bash
   vlog src/*.v testbench/test_case_1.v
   vsim -c -do "run -all"
   ```
4. View the simulation results in the waveform viewer.

### Analyzing Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Verifies basic arithmetic operations (`ADD`, `SUBTRACT`, `MULTIPLY`).
- **Test Case 2**: Tests immediate operations (`ADD IMMEDIATE`, `SUBTRACT IMMEDIATE`, `SELECT IMMEDIATE`).
- **Test Case 3**: Focuses on branching, memory operations (`LOAD`, `STORE`), and halting instructions (`BRANCH`, `HALT`).

## How It Works

### Pipelining Stages
The processor implements a 5-stage pipeline:
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**: Fetches the instruction from memory.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**: Decodes the instruction and reads registers.
3. **Execute (EX)**: Performs arithmetic/logic operations or calculates branch targets.
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**: Accesses data memory if required.
5. **Write Back (WB)**: Writes results back to the register file.

### Control Signals
The control unit generates appropriate signals for each stage, ensuring proper operation and handling hazards when required.

## Testing and Verification
- The processor has been tested against three test cases, covering:
  - Functional correctness of supported instructions.
  - Handling of immediate values.
  - Proper branching, memory operations, and halting behavior.
- Waveforms generated during simulations provide a visual verification of pipeline execution.
